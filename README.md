A Chrome extension that displays a Scratch user's favorite Ocular color on their profile.

## Usage
Download and unzip this repo, then open `chrome://extensions` in your browser and enable developer mode. Finally, click `load unpacked` and select the `Ocular Colors` folder.


## Why?
I made this extension as an opportunity to learn **how** to create Chrome extensions, not because there is any shortage of extensions that have features similiar to this.

Also, I was  testing the `git` and `gh` cli on this repo. :rofl:
